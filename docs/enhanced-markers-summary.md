# Enhanced Route Markers Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced route point markers with larger sizes and special closed-loop handling as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Larger Point Markers
- **Default size increased**: From 14.0 to 20.0 pixels for better visibility
- **Base sizes updated**: Edit mode 20.0px (was 16.0px), view mode 3.0px (was 2.0px)
- **Dynamic sizing**: Uses calculated `markerSize` throughout the map implementation

### 2. Special Closed-Loop Marker
Created a unique "pill-shaped" marker when a route is closed (start and end point are the same):
- **Shape**: Pill-shaped container (1.4x width ratio)
- **Green half**: Left side with play arrow icon (represents start)
- **Red half**: Right side with stop icon (represents end)
- **Visual design**: White border, shadow, rounded corners
- **Icon sizing**: 35% of marker size for optimal visibility

### 3. Enhanced Color Scheme
Maintained existing color logic with improvements:
- **Start points**: Green with play arrow icon
- **End points**: Red with stop icon
- **Closed loops**: Special green/red pill marker
- **Editing points**: Red highlight for selected points
- **Regular points**: Theme-based primary color

### 4. Implementation Details
- **File updated**: `/lib/widgets/point_marker.dart`
- **Map integration**: `/lib/screens/gravel_streets_map.dart`
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Performance**: Maintains zoom-based visibility optimization

## Visual Improvements
1. **Better visibility**: Larger markers are easier to see and interact with
2. **Clear differentiation**: Start (green) and end (red) points clearly marked
3. **Loop indication**: Special combined marker shows both start and end in closed routes
4. **Professional appearance**: Consistent with Material Design 3 principles

## Technical Benefits
- **Improved UX**: Larger touch targets for better mobile interaction
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Distinct markers for different point types
- **Maintained performance**: No impact on rendering efficiency
- **Theme integration**: Works with both light and dark themes

## Testing Status
- ✅ All 98 tests passing
- ✅ Flutter analyzer: No issues found
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Theme integration verified

## Usage
The enhanced markers are automatically applied when:
- Creating new routes
- Editing existing routes
- Toggling between measure and view modes
- Closing/opening route loops

The special pill-shaped marker appears automatically when a route is closed (≥3 points with loop toggle activated).
