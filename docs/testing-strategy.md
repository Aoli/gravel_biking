# Testing Strategy for Gravel First

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Gravel First Flutter application, covering all stages of development and ensuring high-quality code throughout the roadmap.

## Testing Philosophy

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features to ensure code quality and design.
**Continuous Testing**: Automated testing pipeline integrated with CI/CD for immediate feedback.
**Comprehensive Coverage**: Unit, widget, integration, and end-to-end testing for complete validation.

## Testing Types and Structure

### 1. Unit Tests (`test/unit/`)

Test individual functions, classes, and services in isolation.

#### Coverage Areas:
- **Services**: `MeasurementService`, `RouteService`, `LocationService`, `FileService`
- **Models**: `SavedRoute`, `LatLngData` with Hive serialization
- **Utilities**: `CoordinateUtils`, distance calculations, data parsing
- **Business Logic**: Route calculations, validation, data transformations

#### Testing Standards:
- Mock external dependencies using `mocktail`
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Achieve 90%+ code coverage for business logic
- Fast execution (< 100ms per test)

### 2. Widget Tests (`test/widget/`)

Test UI components and their behavior in isolation.

#### Coverage Areas:
- **Screens**: `GravelStreetsMap`, `SavedRoutesPage`
- **Widgets**: `PointMarker`, `DistancePanel`, custom components
- **User Interactions**: Taps, gestures, form inputs
- **State Management**: Widget state changes and updates
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark theme rendering

#### Testing Standards:
- Use `WidgetTester` for interactions
- Test accessibility features
- Verify visual elements and layouts
- Mock external services and data
- Golden tests for visual regression prevention

### 3. Integration Tests (`integration_test/`)

Test complete user workflows and feature interactions.

#### Coverage Areas:
- **Route Creation**: Full route planning workflow
- **File Operations**: Import/export GeoJSON and GPX files
- **Route Management**: Save, load, edit, delete routes
- **Map Interactions**: Zoom, pan, marker interactions
- **Location Services**: GPS functionality and permissions

#### Testing Standards:
- Test real device capabilities
- Use Patrol for advanced interactions
- Test cross-platform compatibility
- Validate end-to-end user journeys
- Performance testing under load

### 4. Performance Tests (`test/performance/`)

Ensure application performance meets standards.

#### Coverage Areas:
- **Map Rendering**: Frame rates during complex operations
- **Data Processing**: Large route handling and calculations
- **Memory Usage**: Route storage and garbage collection
- **Network Operations**: API calls and data fetching
- **Database Operations**: Hive performance with large datasets

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Pipeline
1. **Code Quality**: Flutter analyze, formatting checks
2. **Unit Tests**: Run all unit tests with coverage reporting
3. **Widget Tests**: Execute widget tests with golden file validation
4. **Integration Tests**: Run on multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web)
5. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations
6. **Build Verification**: Ensure builds complete successfully
7. **Deployment**: Automated deployment for passing builds

### Quality Gates
- **90% Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage requirement for merge
- **Zero Analysis Issues**: No Flutter analyzer warnings or errors
- **All Tests Pass**: Complete test suite must pass
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet established performance criteria
- **Security Scan**: No high-severity security issues

## Testing Tools and Dependencies

### Core Testing Framework
- `flutter_test`: Built-in Flutter testing framework
- `integration_test`: Official integration testing package
