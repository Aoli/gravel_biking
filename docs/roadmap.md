# Roadmap

This document tracks feature work one by one with clear status and brief notes.

- [x] **Hierarchical Control System**: Master-detail UI pattern with conditional visibility and auto-disable logic.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë28)
  - What: Implemented sophisticated control hierarchy with segment switch as master control:
    - **Segment Switch**: Moved measure mode toggle from app bar to control panel as green "Redigera" / red "View mode" states
    - **Conditional Visibility**: Edit mode toggle only appears when segment switch is in "Redigera" (green) state
    - **Auto-disable Logic**: Switching to "View mode" automatically disables edit mode and clears any active editing state
    - **Master-Detail Pattern**: Segment switch acts as master control governing both its own state and edit mode toggle visibility
    - **Consistent UI Flow**: Prevents inconsistent states where edit mode could be active during View mode
    - **Clean Implementation**: Uses `if (widget.measureEnabled)` conditional rendering in widget lists for clean toggling
  - Benefits: Intuitive UX hierarchy, prevents UI inconsistencies, cleaner control flow, professional interaction patterns

    - `utils/` for utility functions
    - `widgets/` for reusable UI components
  - Result: Reduced main.dart to 1,459 lines (20% reduction) while preserving all functionality

- [x] Saved Routes: Save up to 5 named routes locally on device.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë25)
  - What: Save current routes with custom names, stored locally using SharedPreferences. Quick-save button in distance panel and full management in drawer.
  - Notes: Routes auto-center when loaded; FIFO removal when limit exceeded; JSON serialization for persistence.

- [x] Subtle build/version watermark overlay.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: Bottom‚Äëleft label like "v0.1.0 #27". Version automatically read from pubspec.yaml; build number from CI via `--dart-define=BUILD_NUMBER`.
  - Notes: Also displayed in app drawer footer. Uses package_info_plus for automatic version detection.

- [x] Fix icon contrast in app drawer and locate me button.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë25)
  - What: Improved visibility of drawer icons and locate me button in both light and dark themes.

- [x] Prepare TRV NVDB gravel overlay switch (disabled).
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë25)
  - What: Added second gravel overlay switch in drawer for future Trafikverket NVDB integration.

  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: You can close/re-open the loop via a button in the distance panel (visible when 3+ points). When closed, the polyline connects last‚Üífirst and the panel lists a "Loop segment" plus updated total.
  - Notes: Adding a new point automatically re-opens the loop; Undo/Clear recompute segments. Implementation lives in `lib/main.dart` with `_loopClosed` state and `_recomputeSegments()` logic.

- [x] Editable points (tap to select and move; long‚Äëpress to delete).
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: Tap a marker to select it, then tap on map to move. Long‚Äëpress a marker to delete it. Distances recompute and loop state updates.
  - Notes: Selected marker is visually highlighted; panel shows an "Editing point #N" banner with a cancel button.

- [x] Export/import routes (GeoJSON).
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: Export current route as GeoJSON (FeatureCollection with a LineString) and import GeoJSON files to restore a route. Preserves loopClosed when present in properties.
  - Notes: Uses `file_picker` and `file_saver` packages. Actions now live in the App Drawer under "GeoJSON".

- [x] Fetch gravel data based on the visible map bounds and refresh on move.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: When the map moves, a 500ms debounce triggers a fetch for the current visible bounds. Parsing happens off the UI thread; polylines are replaced.
  - Notes: Avoids redundant calls by comparing last fetched bounds with a small tolerance.

- [x] GPX import/export support.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: Export current route as GPX 1.1 (trk/trkseg/trkpt). Import GPX and populate route points from trkpt lat/lon. Loop inferred if the track is closed (first==last); dedupes last point internally.
  - Notes: Actions live in the App Drawer under "GPX".

- [x] Improve discoverability of Import/Export by moving actions to an App Drawer with ExpansionTiles.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - Notes: Drawer contains GeoJSON and GPX sections (initiallyExpanded: false). Replaced the earlier on-map card/buttons. Icons and text use high contrast.

- [x] Add "Locate me" (GPS) button.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: Requests permission via geolocator and shows a circular marker at current position. Error toasts if services disabled or permission denied.

- [x] Center map on my location when using "Locate me".
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - What: After location is acquired, the map recenters to your position using the last known zoom level (fallback to 14).
  - Notes: Uses a `MapController.move(latLng, zoom)` call; currently instant (no animation). We can add a smooth camera animation later if desired.

- [x] Make route point markers smaller and remove numeric labels.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - Notes: Markers are now compact circular dots with a subtle border/shadow; editing selection is highlighted.

- [x] Add a Drawer switch to toggle the Overpass gravel overlay visibility.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - Notes: New "Gravel overlay" SwitchListTile in the Drawer controls visibility of the gravel PolylineLayer.

- [x] Standardize map tiles to OpenStreetMap for both light and dark themes.
  - Status: Done (2025‚Äë08‚Äë24)
  - Notes: Removed Stadia dark tiles; now using the same OSM tile URL for all themes.

- [ ] Caching and offline support for both tiles and fetched geometries.
  - Criteria: Tiles cached with sensible max-age; offline viewing of previously seen areas; cached gravel data persistence.
  - Approach: Consider flutter_map_tile_caching for tiles (note GPLv3/commercial licensing considerations), or a simple custom cache. Persist Overpass results locally (e.g., sqflite/hive) keyed by bbox/zoom.
