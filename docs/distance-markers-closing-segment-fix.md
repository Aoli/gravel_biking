# Distance Markers Regeneration Fix

## Issue Description
Two related issues with distance marker regeneration:

1. **Closing segment issue**: When closing a route (toggling from open to closed loop), distance markers were not being generated for the closing segment that connects the last point back to the first point.

2. **Waypoint moving issue**: When moving a waypoint in edit mode, distance markers remained in their original positions and were not repositioned along the updated polyline.

## Root Cause
The issue was in both the main screen (`GravelStreetsMap`) and the measurement service (`MeasurementService`). Several key operations used `_updateDistanceMarkersIfVisible()` which only regenerated markers if they were already visible (i.e., if the distance markers toggle was ON).

This meant that:
- If a user created a route and then closed it **without** first enabling distance markers, no markers would be generated for the closing segment
- When moving waypoints, markers would stay in their old positions unless distance markers were explicitly enabled
- The route shape changes were calculated correctly, but markers weren't repositioned to match

## Solution
Updated both the main screen and measurement service to always regenerate distance markers when route shape changes, regardless of current visibility settings.

### Changes Made

#### 1. GravelStreetsMap (`lib/screens/gravel_streets_map.dart`)
```dart
void _toggleLoop() {
  if (_routePoints.length < 3) return;
  _saveStateForUndo(); // Save state before toggling loop
  setState(() {
    _loopClosed = !_loopClosed;
    _recomputeSegments();
    // Always regenerate distance markers when toggling loop state
    // This ensures markers are generated for the closing segment
    _autoGenerateDistanceMarkers(); 
  });
}
```

**Before**: Called `_updateDistanceMarkersIfVisible()` which only worked if markers were already enabled
**After**: Calls `_autoGenerateDistanceMarkers()` which always generates markers

#### 2. Waypoint Moving (`lib/screens/gravel_streets_map.dart`)
```dart
if (editingIndex != null) {
  // Save state before moving point
  _saveStateForUndo();
  // Move selected point to this location
  _routePoints[editingIndex] = latLng;
  ref.read(editingIndexProvider.notifier).state = null;
  _recomputeSegments();
  // Always regenerate distance markers when moving a waypoint
  // to ensure they stay positioned correctly along the updated polyline
  _autoGenerateDistanceMarkers();
```

**Before**: Called `_updateDistanceMarkersIfVisible()` which only worked if markers were already enabled
**After**: Calls `_autoGenerateDistanceMarkers()` which always generates markers

#### 3. MeasurementService Route Modifications
Updated multiple methods to always regenerate markers when route shape changes:

- `moveRoutePoint()`: Always regenerates markers when waypoints are moved
- `addPointBetween()`: Always regenerates markers when inserting points between existing ones  
- `deletePoint()`: Always regenerates markers when deleting points
- `toggleLoop()`: Always regenerates markers when toggling loop state

#### 4. Dependency Fix (`lib/main.dart`)
Also fixed web compatibility issues by removing `dart:html` import that was causing test failures on non-web platforms.

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass (77/77)
- ✅ Created comprehensive test that verified the fix works correctly
- ✅ Test confirmed that closed loops now generate more markers than open routes (as expected)
- ✅ No performance regressions

## Behavior After Fix
1. **User creates route**: Route points are added normally
2. **User toggles to close route**: Distance markers are automatically generated for the entire route including the closing segment
3. **Markers are generated**: Even if distance markers weren't previously enabled, they are now calculated and stored
4. **Display controlled separately**: Whether markers are visible is still controlled by the distance markers toggle in the UI

## Benefits
- ✅ Closing segments now get proper distance markers
- ✅ Moving waypoints automatically repositions distance markers along new polyline
- ✅ Adding/deleting points regenerates markers for accurate positioning
- ✅ No manual intervention needed - works automatically
- ✅ Maintains existing behavior for all other scenarios
- ✅ No breaking changes to the API
- ✅ Performance impact minimal (only when route shape changes)

This fix ensures that users will always have complete and accurate distance marker coverage for their routes, including:
- The important closing segment that completes a loop
- Properly positioned markers when waypoints are moved during editing
- Accurate marker placement when points are added or removed

All distance marker operations now work consistently regardless of current visibility settings, providing a more intuitive and reliable user experience.
